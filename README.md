🚀 Full Stack Developer | 💡 Tech Enthusiast | 🎨 Design Enthusiast

Hey there! 👋 I'm Lishu Gupta, a passionate Full Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into reality through code. 
My tech toolkit includes TypeScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and NestJS, which I blend seamlessly with design tools like Figma and Blender to create eye-catching interfaces. 
From crafting cloud functions on Google Cloud Platform to solving coding puzzles, 
I'm all about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world. Let's collaborate and create something amazing together! 🌟

🔧 Armed with a passion for both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy blending creativity and functionality to build user interfaces that captivate and delight. But wait, there's more! I'm not just a developer; I'm also a design enthusiast who paints digital canvases with tools like Figma and Blender, breathing life into ideas and concepts.

⚙️ When I'm not busy crafting lines of code, you can find me immersed in the fascinating world of cloud computing. Google Cloud Platform is my playground, where I tinker with cloud functions, deploy applications, and unravel the mysteries of scalable solutions.

🧩 As an advocate of open source, I believe in the power of collaboration. I actively contribute to various open source projects, embracing the spirit of community-driven development. Together, we can make technology more accessible, robust, and exciting.
