🚀 Full Stack Developer | DevOps Leader | AI & LLM Enthusiast | Cloud Solutions Architect

Hey there! 👋 I'm Lishu Gupta, a passionate Full Stack Developer and DevOps leader dedicated to building scalable, cutting-edge solutions. I specialize in crafting seamless, high-performance applications using TypeScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, NestJS, and Python, while integrating AI workflows and LLM models to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world. My cloud expertise spans across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, where I design cloud-native applications and automate infrastructure using tools like Terraform and Docker.

🔧 I thrive on creating both the front-end and back-end components that make up modern, responsive web applications. With a focus on user-centered design, I turn ideas into beautifully functional digital experiences. From developing cloud-based functions to deploying efficient and scalable solutions, my goal is to bridge technology with creativity to deliver robust, user-friendly platforms.

⚙️ When I’m not building applications, you’ll find me exploring the exciting world of DevOps—automating processes, optimizing cloud deployments, and enhancing CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth, efficient delivery of applications. I’m passionate about infrastructure as code, containerization, and streamlining development workflows for faster, reliable product launches.

🧩 As an advocate for open-source development, I actively contribute to projects that foster collaboration and innovation. By sharing knowledge and building community-driven tools, I aim to make technology more accessible and empower developers worldwide to create exceptional solutions.

🌌 Whether you’re a fellow tech enthusiast, a team looking to innovate, or simply someone eager to learn and collaborate, join me on this exciting journey of technological discovery. Let's connect, collaborate, and build the next generation of digital experiences! 🌟
